<p style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;"> I am a dancer, also a videographer focusing on dance film. My body is my material of art most of the time. 
    I have been training hard on my physical abilities to maintain my dance life. After having passion on dance for 11 years, from Hiphop dance to contemporary dance, from New school to Old school,
     also from China to US, my view of dance has opened so much. Dance is a big culture of world, it contains the diversity of different culture. My area of expertise is pop dance. The more I learned, 
     the more I surprised of the possibility of human body. I enjoy experimenting in dance. Flow and momentum are the two most used elements in my dance style. This two elements can be either balance 
     or conflict. If human body is a car, then flow is the direction of where the driver want to go and momentum is the direction of where the car itself want to go. Dance is a language, different 
     individual has different way of speaking. Dance film is a way to recorded and improves this language. I learned dance film for 3 years, I was amazed by the result of the combination of dance and 
     videography. In dance film, dancer is no longer lonely. Dance moves express with video techniques creates more possibilities, and that is a whole new world for me to explore.   </p>
